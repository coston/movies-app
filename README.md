# Movies App

## Notice

I built this app as a coding test from a potential employer.

## Build Notes

- SSR API Requests for speed and guarding resources
- SSR Movies List and filtering for percieved speed
- CSR Movie Details to ensure theyâ€™re fully indexable by search engines
- Shadcn components and theming used to accelerate development (see components/ui)

## Assignment Details

### The task

As a user,

- I can search for movies and see a paginated list of results
- I can filter search results by genre
- I can navigate through the next and previous pages of the paginated results
- I see the total count of search results
- I see notable information for each search result, such as the summary, poster,
  duration, rating, etc.

### Feedback

- My goal was to push a complete demo of streamlined work with completed requirements, tests, and a good basic ci/cd workflow.
- I'm pleased with the speed using a mix of SSR and CSR.
- A follow-up feature may be to improve how I handle total count of search results. This is currently page results, as movie count is not part of GET /movies. I would go back to product to clarify this requirement. If needed, I would update GET /movies with the count rather than using another request.

## Running the project

1. Add `API_BASE_URL` to `.env`
2. `npm run dev`
